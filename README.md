Early attempt to create recursion-based RPG with save file and open choices


Welcome to my first attempt at a C++ based RPG game utlizing recently (in 2020) learned programming techniques

Some highlights are:
Object-oriented programming for dynamic enemy types with varying species, health, and attack
Separation of classes in file strucutre using .cpp and .h files
Player-choice turn-based combat system with various attack types.
Interactive menu and shop mecahnics for improving/upgrading player
Save file for saving progress offline and loading in player. User can view stats save here at any point.
